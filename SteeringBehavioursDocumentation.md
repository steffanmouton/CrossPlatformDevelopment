## Requirements Documentation

- Description of Problem
  - Name: Steering Behaviour
  - Problem Statement: Create 'lifelike' movement of AI agents using steering behaviour algorithms
  - Problem Specification: Can be done in pygame or in Unity. Can be proven via test cases in console or by visual representation
- Output Information
  - I opted to use Unity, and proof is via visual representation

- User Interface Information
  - Unity Project. EXE build only shows Wander behaviour. Must view in Unity Engine to see other behaviours.
